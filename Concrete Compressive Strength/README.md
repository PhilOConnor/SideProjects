# Purpose

To explore different preprocessing and regression algorithms on an engineering problem - the compressive strength of concrete using data from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sinamhd9/concrete-comprehensive-strength). It's been a while since I've studied concrete and construction materials so I'll be relying on Materials for Engineering, 3rd edition chapter 4.4 by John Martin for the impact of differnent fearutes present in the dataset, as there are some strange linear relationships between attributes - mainly blast (furnace slag, cement), (blast furnace slag, fly ash).
